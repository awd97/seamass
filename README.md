Depends on _HDF5_, _Boost_ and _libspatialindex_. **Note: _libspatialindex_ MUST be at least version 1.8.5**. Windows developers can get these from the [dependency repository](https://github.com/biospi/seamass-windeps). Also currently requires _Intel MKL_ and preferably the _Intel C++ Compiler 13.0 or greater_.

building
-------
Run the cmake.sh or cmake.bat file for your platform, which will create make files for compilation in build/debug and build/release subfolders.
